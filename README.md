# User Authentication and JWT Example
This project is a practical example demonstrating how to implement user authentication and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in a web application with protected views. It provides a clear, concise foundation for understanding secure user management in Node.js applications using EJS for templating.

## Technologies Used

* HTML / CSS / JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express.js

## Features
With this project, you can:

* Register New Users: Create new user accounts, with passwords securely stored using hashing and salting.
* Login Users: Authenticate users by verifying their credentials against the database.
* Manage User Sessions with Cookies: Store and retrieve user authentication status efficiently using HTTP-only cookies for security.
* Implement Protected Routes: Restrict access to certain parts of your application, ensuring only authenticated users can view sensitive content.
* Utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Understand how JWTs are generated, signed, and verified to secure API endpoints and maintain session state.
* Refactor with Middleware: Learn to use Express.js middleware to centralize authentication logic, keeping your routes clean and organized.
* Logout Users: Provide functionality for users to securely end their sessions by clearing authentication cookies.

# Getting Started
This project is designed to be straightforward, allowing you to quickly set up and explore the core concepts of authentication and JWTs in a full-stack context.
