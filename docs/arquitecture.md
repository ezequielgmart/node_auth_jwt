## Explanation of Components
src/ (Source Code)
Contains all the source code for your application.

* **config/** 
Purpose: Stores the application's global configuration, such as environment variables, JWT secrets, database settings, ports, etc.
Benefit: Centralizes all configuration, making it easy to manage and adapt for different environments (development, production).

* **middleware/**
Purpose: Holds Express middleware functions that run before or after controllers to perform tasks like authentication, authorization, general request validation, error handling, logging, etc.
Benefit: Separates cross-cutting concerns from controllers, promoting reusability and keeping controllers clean.

* **utils/**
Purpose: This is where you place generic utility functions that are not directly related to a specific feature's business logic but are used by multiple parts of the application.
Examples: Functions for password hashing, JWT generation/verification (if not part of a more complex authentication service), data formatters, generic validation helpers, etc.

* **features/ (Feature/Domain-based Organization)**
Purpose: This is the core of modern organization. Each subdirectory represents a feature or business domain of your application (e.g., users, job_applications, employers, auth). Inside each feature, you group all related filesAuth.
Benefit:Auth


* **app.js**
Purpose: Configures the Express instance. This is where you register your global middlewares and mount your main routes (generally by importing them from the *.routes.js files of your features). It does not contain business logic.

* **server.js**
Purpose: The entry point of your application. Here you import app.js and start the Express server, listening on a specific port. You might also handle the initial database connection here.
